### Certainly! Here are some key points about the project that you can include in your resume:

1. **Developed a command-line shopping cart application in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.**

2. **Implemented functionality to add products to the cart, view cart contents, and perform checkout with payment handling.**

3. **Utilized classes such as Product, Item, and Cart to model the data and operations of the shopping cart system.**

4. **Demonstrated proficiency in C++ programming, data structures (e.g., vectors, unordered_map), and fundamental OOP concepts (e.g., encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism).**


### Project-related Counter Questions:

1. **How would you enhance the shopping cart functionality to handle discounts or promotional offers?**
   - We could introduce a mechanism to apply discounts to individual products or the entire cart during checkout. This could be implemented by extending the `Product` class to include discount attributes or by adding discount-related methods to the `Cart` class.

2. **Suppose we want to allow users to remove items from the cart. How would you implement this feature?**
   - We can add a method to the `Cart` class to remove items based on their ID or name. This method would iterate through the items in the cart and remove the specified item if found.

3. **In the current implementation, all products are hardcoded. How could we modify the program to load products from an external data source, such as a database or a CSV file?**
   - We could create a separate class responsible for loading products from external sources. This class would handle reading the data and converting it into `Product` objects, which can then be added to the `allProducts` vector.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Counter Questions:

1. **Explain the concept of encapsulation and how it is implemented in the provided code.**
   - Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, i.e., a class. In the provided code, classes such as `Product`, `Item`, and `Cart` encapsulate data (e.g., product details, cart items) and methods (e.g., calculating total price, adding products).

2. **What is inheritance, and how could it be utilized in this project?**
   - Inheritance is a mechanism in which a new class inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class. In the context of this project, we could introduce an inheritance hierarchy for different types of products. For example, we could have a base `Product` class and derived classes such as `ElectronicsProduct` and `GroceryProduct`, inheriting common attributes from the base class.

3. **How does polymorphism contribute to the flexibility and extensibility of the code?**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In the provided code, polymorphism is demonstrated through the use of virtual functions. For instance, different types of products (e.g., electronics, groceries) could have their own implementations of a common method like `getDisplayName()`, providing flexibility in how product information is displayed.

4. **Explain the difference between a class and an object. Provide examples from the provided code.**
   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and behaviors. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. In the provided code, `Product`, `Item`, and `Cart` are classes. For example, `Product` defines the attributes and methods for a product, while an object of the `Product` class represents a specific product, such as an apple or a banana.
